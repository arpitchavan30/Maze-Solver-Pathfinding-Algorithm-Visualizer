# Maze-Solver-Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer

An interactive Java Swing application to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms in action.
The project demonstrates Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra’s Algorithm on randomly generated mazes, highlighting traversal patterns and shortest path detection.

Multiple Algorithms – DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
Real-time Visualization – Step-by-step traversal shown directly on the grid.
Interactive Target Selection – Click on any grid cell to set a custom target location.
Execution Timer – Measures algorithm runtime to compare performance.
Reset & Regenerate Maze – Try multiple maze layouts without restarting.
